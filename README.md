# go-github-runner

Go wrapper for GitHub Actions internal runner APIs.

The `schemas` directory contains OpenAPI schemas. These have been created using a combination of reverse engineering and manual enrichment, using [mitmproxy](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy) and [mitmproxy2swagger](https://github.com/alufers/mitmproxy2swagger), as well as from the [runner](https://github.com/actions/runner) source.
